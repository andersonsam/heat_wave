# Modelling the streamflow response to heatwaves across glacierized basins in southwestern Canada

Code associated with the paper "Modelling the streamflow response to heatwaves across glacierized basins in southwestern Canada" by Sam Anderson and Valentina Radic (2023).

This study applies previously trained deep learning hydrological models ([code](https://github.com/andersonsam/cnn_lstm_era) / [paper 1](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/26/795/2022/hess-26-795-2022.html) / [paper 2](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frwa.2022.934709/full)) to simulate the streamflow response to heatwaves at 111 basins in southwestern Canada.  

For detailed information about the results and their implications, please see the associated paper.  See below for a brief overview of context and results of this study.

## Simulation Results: Individual basins

The streamflow response to heatwaves can be characterized by two features: an initial streamflow surplus ($\Delta Q_{max}$), and a delayed streamflow deficit ($\Delta Q_{min}$).

## Simulation Results: Regional scale

$\Delta Q_{max}$ and $\Delta Q_{min}$ vary by the timing of heatwave onset and by glacier coverage ($G$).
